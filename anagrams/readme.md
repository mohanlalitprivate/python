# Anagram Finder
## Requirements

- Python 3.0 or latest
- ```dictionary.txt``` file in the same folder as the anagram.py file
- For example you can create a dir 'src' then copy the file anagram.py and dictionary.txt into that dir
- From 'src' dir (above step)```> python anagram.py``` 
    (assuming you have set the path to invoke Python 3 using this command)
    
- Dir 'tests' contains tests, hence the file requirements.txt and tox.ini
- Create virtual env and after switching to that env, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- To run test simply type ```tox``` or ```py.test``` from 'tests' dir
